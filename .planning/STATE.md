# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-18)

**Core value:** Make digital amp sims and DI recordings sound like they were recorded in a real room with a real microphone -- through physically-modeled environmental layers, not reverb effects.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 Complete. Next: Phase 2 (Cabinet Resonance FDN)

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Project Scaffold & Audio Pipeline) -- COMPLETE
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase
Status: Phase Complete
Last activity: 2026-02-18 -- Completed 01-02-PLAN.md

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 12%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 6min
- Total execution time: 0.2 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 - Project Scaffold | 2 | 11min | 6min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (7min), 01-02 (4min)
- Trend: Accelerating

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 8 phases derived from 70 requirements at comprehensive depth
- Roadmap: FDN stages grouped -- Cabinet alone (Phase 2) to prove primitives, then ER + Tail together (Phase 3)
- Roadmap: UI and Visualization split into separate phases (6 and 7) due to distinct deliverables
- 01-01: 19 parameters registered (plan stated 20 but detailed spec lists 19)
- 01-01: Stage-prefixed snake_case parameter IDs for sorted DAW automation lists
- 01-01: Text-label float params for Room Size/Shape/Proximity (continuous 0-1 with descriptive display)
- 01-01: GenericAudioProcessorEditor for parameter testing until Phase 6 custom UI
- 01-02: Auto-gain compensation (-2.5dB * pow(mix, 1.5)) causes expected volume drop with passthrough stages -- self-corrects when DSP stages add energy
- 01-02: sin3dB crossfade creates +3dB constructive sum at 50% with correlated signals -- normalizes with decorrelated wet signal
- 01-02: Stage convention established: concrete class with prepare/process/reset/setBypass (no virtual base)
- 01-02: processBlock order: ScopedNoDenormals -> clear unused channels -> updateStageParams -> dry capture -> 6 stages -> mix -> auto-gain -> output trim
